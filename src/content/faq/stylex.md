title: Introduction to StyleX
description: StyleX combines the strengths and avoids the weaknesses of both inline styles and static CSS. Defining and using styles requires only local knowledge within a component, and avoids specificity issues while retaining features like Media Queries. StyleX builds optimized styles using collision-free atomic CSS which is superior to what could be authored and maintained by hand.
